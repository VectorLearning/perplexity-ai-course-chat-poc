            "transcript": "Rigging up is placing and assembling the various parts of equipment that make up the rig, and preparing the rig for drilling. There are many rig designs, and this course does not cover each type individually. This course focuses on the common hazards and solutions that many rig designs share. During assembly of the rig, some equipment may be handled and set with crane, rig up trucks, or forklift, depending on the size of the rig. It should be noted that overhead hazards such as high voltage power lines may be present. Topics covered in this chapter include Setting up the substructure Setting up the rig floor and master derrick Installing handrails, guardrails, stairs, walkways, and ladders Installing the power system Rigging up the circulating system Installing the auxiliary equipment Inspecting the rig Rigging down There may be two or more crews working together in the rigging up process. The rigging up process includes the following steps. Some of which are done simultaneously. Servicing, rigging up Transporting and rigging up the equipment is the first step in well servicing operations. After these steps, servicing activities commence. After the drilling rig is removed, the well site is cleaned and re-leveled for the service rig. A work-over rig is driven or transported to the site and positioned at the well. Potential hazards Working in unstable or slippery conditions on the lease road-slash-drill site. Striking fixed objects such as power line poles. Contacting electrical service lines. Being involved in vehicular accidents. Getting caught between the rig and the wellhead. Being struck by a moving rig. Possible solutions Inspect the route in advance for adequate vehicle access and satisfactory surface conditions. Ensure adequate driver training. Ensure proper vehicle maintenance. Establish and follow a specific procedure for positioning the rig. Use a ground guide while backing the rig up. Keep all personnel clear of the moving rig. Before rigging up, guide line anchors are set into the ground and pull tested. The service rig is then spotted over the well. The truck or trailer mounted rig is stabilized and leveled by manual or hydraulic jacks. All guide lines are uncoiled and laid out to remove kinks or knots. The mast is readied for raising, then raised and guide into place. The derrick emergency escape device is rigged up and the work platform is readied for service operations. Potential hazards Being electrocuted by overhead power lines. Slips, trips, and falls as a result of unstable or slippery conditions. Being caught between the mast and mast cradle or being struck by or caught in guide lines and cables when mast is being raised. Being struck by a toppling mast if the carrier shifts. Being sprayed with oil if the hydraulic cylinder or hoses fail as mast is being raised. Twisting and falling of the mast if the guide line or anchor breaks or fails. Receiving strains and sprains. Getting hand, finger, and foot injuries during rig up. Getting the climbing assist counterweight tangled in the mast. Possible Solutions Identify all electrical hazards and maintain adequate clearances. 29 CFR 1910.303 Table S3 Take appropriate precautions to mitigate slip, trip, and fall hazards. Stay clear of the unit while the mast is being raised, lowered, or telescoped. Uncoil and visually inspect. Uncoil and visually inspect all cables before starting to raise the mast. Stand to the side of lines and cables as the mast is being raised. Inspect the well pad and set additional foundation materials as appropriate. Inspect all high pressure hoses and fittings. Ensure that the unit operator assesses the wind speed and direction to determine if the mast can be raised safely. Allow no personnel on the unit, other than the operator working at the controls, when raising or lowering the mast. All others stand clear. Possible Solutions Inspect all anchors before rigging up the mast. Anchors should meet American Petroleum Institute specifications for loads and guying patterns. 2004 Publications, Programs, and Services American Petroleum Institute Use proper lifting techniques. Use proper hand and foot placement. See General Safety and Health. Control the position of the counterweight by maintaining tension on the guy wire to keep the weight away from the mast.

Then, the drawworks is set in place and secured to the substructure. On mechanical rigs, the engines are set in place in the compound and associated equipment connected to the drawworks. On electric rigs, the electric cables, lines, are strung to the drawworks. The bottom of the mast is raised to the rig floor and pinned in place. The crown section is then raised into place on the derrick stand. The a-legs are raised and pinned into place. The monkey board is pinned in place on the mast and all lines and cables are laid out to prevent tangling when the mast is raised. A thorough inspection of the mast should be made before raising the mast-slash-derrick. The mast is now ready to be raised. The engines are started, see installing the power system at the end of this chapter, and the drilling line is spooled onto the drawworks drum. Once the mast has been raised and pinned, the remaining floor equipment can be set into place.

            "transcript": "The driller uses the drawworks to raise the kelly and attach joint out of the mouse hole. Potential Hazards Being struck by debris or overhead objects if the traveling block runs into the crown block or if the traveling block or swivel hits the derrick. Being struck by kelly or pipe. Possible Solutions Install a crown safety device on the drawworks and ensure proper functioning. Keep personnel clear of the potential swing path of the kelly and pipe. The new joint is guided over to the drill hole, the tool joint is doped, and stabbed into the end of the pipe suspended in the rotary table with the slips. The joints are threaded together using the pipe spinner, kelly spinner, or spinning chain. Final torque is provided by the tongs. The drawworks lifts the kelly and attached string to facilitate removal of the slips. Potential Hazards Being struck by, swinging kelly and pipe. Tongs if the stabber misses the stump. The Jerk or Spinning Chain Being caught between the swinging pipe and the tongs. Being caught between the joint of pipe being stabbed and the stump. Getting pinched between tongs or pipe spinner and pipe. Slips, trips, and falls. Possible Solutions Never step over a jerk chain and stay clear of spinning chain when a connection is being made. Keep hands away from end of stump or inside of pipe. Keep feet and legs away from underneath tongs when the pipe is being stabbed. Use proper tong latching techniques and hand and finger. Use longer placement on tong handles. Never stand or walk under suspended loads. Keep the work area around the rotary table clean and clear of drilling fluids, mud, ice, snow, debris, and other materials that may cause slipping or tripping. Inspect chains for worn or damaged links, and replace a chain having a broken or distorted link with the metal reduced by wear at any point less than 90% of its original cross section area. See Slips, Trips, and Falls Chapter General Safety and Helps See Slips, Trips, and Falls under Chapter General Safety and Helps and health. The driller starts the pump and picks up off the slips. The drill crew then removes the slips. The driller lowers the string until the kelly drive bushing engages the master bushing. Once the bushings are in place, the driller begins rotating the drill string, lowers the bit back to bottom, and continues making hole. Potential hazards. Being thrown off the rotary table when engaged. Getting caught by loose clothing. Possible solutions. Stand clear of the rotary table. In some cases the operator orders a core sample of the formation for testing. A special core barrel is lowered to the bottom on the drill string and is rotated to cut a core from the formation. This core is brought to the surface and examined in a laboratory. Potential hazards. Being pinched or struck by the core barrel and associated tools during floor operations. Being struck by the core as it is removed from the barrel. Encountering other hazards similar to those encountered during tripping out slash in. Possible solutions. Where appropriate PPE. Instruct workers in handling and using the special tools required during drill core extraction."

            "transcript": "Casing is pipe usually larger in diameter and longer than drill pipe and is used to line the hole. Casing operations occur periodically throughout the drilling process starting with the surface casing, intermediate casing, and ending with production string which takes place during well completion. The activities involved in casing operations can vary according to the type of casing being installed, but generally fall into these steps. Installing casing tools. Running casing into the hole. Installing casing accessories. Circulating and cementing. Specialized casing handling tools are necessary to run casing. Note, the special service supervisor should hold a pre-job meeting with the special service crew and other involved personnel to review responsibilities and to coordinate the operations to be performed. Potential hazards. Being struck by or caught between tubulars and other objects during movement, such as being struck by tubulars being tailed or hit by a machine gun. Into the rig floor. Experiencing strains and sprains from maneuvering tools. Falling from work platform and or stabbing board. Possible solutions. Stand clear of suspended, hoisted or moving loads. Be aware of tubulars or equipment being lifted through the v-door. Use proper hand and foot placement to avoid pinch points, including use of tag lines. Use rig floor winch or other powered equipment to handle heavy casing tools. Use fall protection while installing equipment in the derrick. See slips, trips, and falls under Chapter General Safety and Health. Casing is run into the hole to a pre-determined depth. Note, the special service supervisor should hold a pre-job meeting with the special service crew and other involved personnel to review responsibilities and to coordinate the operations to be performed. Potential hazards. Hazards are similar to those for drilling a head or tripping. Getting caught between, struck by, or pinched by the power tongues, casing or other equipment. Being struck by or caught between tubulars and other objects during movement, for example, struck by tubulars being tailed into the rig floor. Falling from the stabbing board or work platform. Getting struck by dropped objects. Possible solutions. Include the casing crew and the drilling crew when conducting a JSA and pre-job safety meeting to coordinate the activities of casing operations. Stand clear of suspended, hoisted, or moving loads. Be aware of tubulars or equipment being lifted through the V-door. Emphasize all normal worker safety procedures, such as fall protection, PPE, placement of hands and feet, and teamwork and communication between workers. Implement full fall protection program for the casing stabber. Identify clearance between the stabbing board and casing elevators. Secure all items used by the casing stabber overhead with a safety line. As casing is being run, accessories such as centralizers, scratchers, guide shoe, and a float collar are installed and used as needed. Note, the special service supervisor should hold a pre-job meeting with the special service crew and other involved personnel to review responsibilities and to coordinate the operations to be performed. Potential hazards. Dropping guide shoe or float collar onto legs or foot. Getting fingers pinched between tools and casing tongs when manually moving guide shoe or float collar. Back strain. Exposure to hazardous materials, especially when using a guide shoe or float collar. Exposure to hazardous materials, especially when using a guide shoe or float collar. threadlock compounds. Possible solutions, use winch, air hoist, or other powered equipment to handle guide shoe, float collar, or other heavy casing equipment. Use appropriate PPE as required by the SDS. After the casing is landed, drilling fluid is circulated through the casing and annulus to remove any residual gases and to condition the mud. After circulating and conditioning the mud, the casing is cemented. During this process the casing is reciprocated or rotated to allow the scratchers to work to remove excess wall cake to give the cement a better bond. Usually another special servicing company is hired to conduct cementing operations. Potential Hazards. Being struck by high pressure lines failing if not secured properly. Having a high pressure connection failure caused by mismatched or excessively worn hammer unions. Possible Solutions. Hobble high pressure lines properly. Use proper equipment inspection techniques to include hammer unions, note, this is a particular problem with 602 and 1502, as they will couple but will not hold beyond the lower pressure rating number.

            "transcript": "Properly trained personnel are essential for well control activities. Well control consists of two basic components, an active component consisting of drilling fluid pressure monitoring activities, and a passive component consisting of the blowout preventers, BOPs. The first line of defense in well control is to have sufficient drilling fluid pressure in the well hole. During drilling, underground fluids such as gas, water, or oil under pressure, the formation pressure opposes the drilling fluid pressure, mud pressure. If the formation pressure is greater than the mud pressure, there is the possibility of a blowout. The activities involved in well control are blowout prevention program, monitoring and maintaining mud system, installing BOPs, accumulator, and choke manifold, testing BOPs accumulators, and choke manifold, maintaining surface control system, blowout preventers. The second line of defense for the work of well control is to have sufficient drilling fluid pressure, mud pressure, and workers in the well to prevent a blowout is the group of equipment called blowout preventers, BOPs. BOPs and associated valves are installed on top of the casing head before drilling a head after rigging up. These high-pressure safety valves and associated equipment are designed to shut off the well hole and prevent the escape of the underground fluids and prevent a blowout from occurring. After installation, the BOP and associated valves are pressure tested to ensure integrity and proper operations. The BOP and associated equipment consists of BOPs and associated valves are installed on top of the casing head before drilling a head after rigging up. The BOPs and associated valves are accompanied by the BOPs and associated \uac1c OR tis. The individual containers are soiled BOPs and associated ERPs and other chips installed in each container, getting to the highest level of dependency equivalent for any gloves of any government and contract showers. When the BOPs are installed, they resemble the original standard KEP systems. BOPs and associated buckles of cutting, lados, etc. When the BOPs and associated buckles are installed, the traditional seventy ice creaker and offended are placed on top of the c\ufffd prev. 1300 LBS frames. Reflect sniff of dust dating form Loading wires and loose middle tops. NRMA V- \u0ba4 AP c\u0169ng Are usually mounted at the top of the bop stack. Ram-type bops have rubber-faced steel rams that come together with great force to seal the wellbore. Usually two or more ram-type bops are mounted in the bop stack. A choke manifold is a system of valves used to circulate out a kick and to circulate mud in of the proper weight. This device responds automatically to a kick and can prevent the blowout if properly installed and maintained. The bop control system, called an accumulator, provides the energy to operate the blowout centers. This system of consists of, compressed gas bottles, regulator valves, pumps, hydraulic reservoir, control manifold, and control valves. Potential hazard, receiving injuries caused by loss of well control. Possible solutions, appropriate training for tasks performed.

The MUDD circulatory system consists of the elements shown in Figure Two. Each part of this system must function and be in good repair to maintain well control. For more information, see Maintenance Activities. If the MUDD level increases, it may be a sign that a kick is in progress. On some rigs there is a MUDD Float Level Gauge' which sounds an automatic alarm if the MUDD is not listed on.

            "transcript": "Hot work is any work that involves burning, welding, using fire or spark-producing tools, or that produces a source of ignition. Welding and cutting operations are common to drilling and servicing operations. Test for flammable gases in the work area before starting any hot work. Potentially hazardous areas include, but are not limited to, wellheads, fuel tanks, mud tanks, tank batteries, gas separators, oil treaters, or confined spaces where gases can accumulate. Hot work, fire, and explosive hazards. Welding, cutting, and brazing. Cylinder storage. Grinding. Wellside ignition sources. Workers performing hot work such as welding, cutting, brazing, soldering, and grinding are exposed to the risk of fires from ignition of flammable or combustible materials in the space, and from leaks of flammable gas into the space, from hot work equipment. Potential hazard. Getting burned by fires or explosions during hot work. Possible solutions. The basic precautions for fire prevention are. Perform hot work in a safe location, or with fire hazards removed or covered. 1910.252A-11 Use guards to confine the heat. Sparks. And slag, and to protect the immovable fire hazards. 1910.252A-12 Special precautions. Do not perform hot work where flammable vapors or combustible materials exist. Work and equipment should be relocated outside of the hazardous areas, when possible. 1910.252A-12 Make suitable fire extinguishing equipment immediately available. Such equipment may consist of pails of water, buckets of sand. 1910.252A-12 Use guards to confine the heat. Sparks. hose, or portable extinguishers. 1910.252A, 2-2. Assign additional personnel, fire watch, to guard against fire while hot work is being performed in locations where anything greater than a minor fire might develop, 1910.252A, 2-3A, or if any of the following conditions exist. Appreciable combustible material is closer than 35 feet to the point of operation. Appreciable combustibles are more than 35 feet away but are easily ignited by sparks. Wall or floor openings within a 35-foot radius expose combustible material in adjacent areas including concealed spaces in walls or floors. Combustible materials are adjacent to the opposite side of metal partitions, walls, ceilings, or roofs and are likely to be ignited by conduction or radiation. Fire watchers shall have fire extinguishing equipment readily available and be trained in its use. Be familiar with facilities for sounding an alarm in the event of a fire. Watch for fires in all exposed areas. Try to extinguish them only when obviously within the capacity of the equipment available, or otherwise sound the alarm. Maintain the fire watch at least a half hour after completion of welding or cutting operations to detect and extinguish possible smoldering fires. 1910.252A, 2-3B. Potential hazard. Getting burned by a flash fire or explosion that results from an accumulation of flammable gases, such as methane or hydrogen sulfide, around the wellhead area. Possible solutions. Monitor the atmosphere with a gas detector. If a flammable or combustible gas exceeds 10% of the lower explosive level, LEL, the work must be stopped. Identify the source of the gas and repair the leakage.

All hot work is potentially hazardous and a hazard assessment should be performed to determine where the hazards exist. Potential Hazard. Injury and Illness Caused by Hot Work, Such as, Welding Fumes, UV Light, Sparks, Noise, or Skin Injury. Possible Solutions. Inspect the work area to ensure that all fuel and ignition sources are isolated by shielding, clearing the area, lockout-slash-tagout, soaking flammable material with water. Wear appropriate PPE, such as face shield, leather welder's vest, and gauntlet gloves. Use cotton or denim clothing. Provide UV shielding for arc welding where practical. Inspect welding and cutting equipment before use, arc or gas welding-slash-burning. Leak test gas torches, gauges. And hoses. Review the hot work permit if available. Ensure the availability of adequate fire watch-slash-fire protection equipment. Ensure adequate ventilation from toxic welding and cutting fumes. Special Hazard. Accumulation of toxic gases within a confined space. A hazardous atmosphere exists in ox welding, cutting and bruising. Egon-deficient, atmospheric concentration of less than 19.5%, or oxygen-enriched, atmospheric concentration of more than. 23.5%. 1,910.146 confined space entry. Possible solutions. Ventilate toxic metal fumes mechanically, if entering a confined space, such as inside of a mud tank, water tank, oil tanks, hoppers, sump, pit or cellar. Use the written permit system to document authorization to enter, the work to be performed, and the results of the gas monitoring where there is a potential for toxic, flammable, or oxygen-deficient fumes.

Hydrogen sulfide or sour gas, H2S, is a flammable, colorless gas that is toxic at extremely low concentrations. It is heavier than air, and may accumulate in low-lying areas. It smells like rotten eggs at low concentrations and causes you to quickly lose your sense of smell. Many areas where the gas is found have been identified, but pockets of the gas can occur anywhere. Iron sulfide is a byproduct of many production operations and may spontaneously combust with air. Flaring operations associated with H2S production will generate sulfur dioxide, SO2, another toxic gas.

Employees may be permitted on location for specific hydrogen sulfide training purposes that does not include general rig training. Pay attention to audible and visual alarm systems. Store the equipment in accessible locations. Two hydrogen sulfide detectors should be present, one should be a properly calibrated, meter detection instrument, and the other should be a pump type with detector tubes. The maximum permissible exposure limit, PL, is 20 parts per million. Respiratory protection would be required if periodic testing indicates employee exposures to H2S at concentrations above the PEL.
