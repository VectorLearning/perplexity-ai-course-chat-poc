  "description": "The use of deadly force is a topic widely discussed, but what happens when the suspect has begun to comply and deadly force is no longer needed? This course illustrates the dangers when de-escalation techniques are not a part of training. Lt. Dennis Smith demonstrates transition drills to stress de-escalation and shows us a scenario where officers must use these techniques.",
