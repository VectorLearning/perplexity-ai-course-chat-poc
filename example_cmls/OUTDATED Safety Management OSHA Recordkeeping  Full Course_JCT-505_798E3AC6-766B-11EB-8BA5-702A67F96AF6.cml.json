            "transcript": "Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, was established to enforce and administer the Act. The Act gives OSHA the authority to set standards and conduct inspections to ensure that employers provide safe and healthful workplaces. One of these standards, 29 CFR 1904, describes the rules for recording and reporting occupational injuries and illnesses. Specific recording and reporting requirements ensure uniform, nationwide data to help analyze causes, identify potential trends, and prevent future occurrences. Injury and illness records are also used locally to implement workplace safety and health. Failure to properly record an injury or illness may result in an OSHA violation and citation. Thus, it is extremely important for all employees to know and understand the OSHA rules and requirements for recording an injury or illness. By the end of this course, you will be able to list the criteria used to determine what makes a case OSHA recordable, describe what makes a case work-related, differentiate between a new case and the recurrence of an existing case, list and describe the general recording criteria, determine if a case is recordable, and describe OSHA's recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including the purpose of the OSHA recordkeeping forms."

The four questions that need to be asked are Did the employee experience an injury or illness? Is the injury or illness work-related? Is the injury or illness a new case? Does the injury or illness meet the general recording criteria or application to specific cases? If the answer to a question is yes, move on to the next question. If the answer to all four questions is yes, then the final step is to record the case on the facility OSHA logs.

If an injury or illness occurred, decide whether or not it is work-related, a new case, and meets either general recording criteria or the criteria for special cases. If the answer to each of these questions is yes, then the injury or illness must be recorded on OSHA's Form 301, Injury and Illness Incident Report, and OSHA's Form 300, Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses. At the start of each year, complete Form 300A, which summarizes all of the injuries and illnesses from the previous year. Form 300A must be physically posted for employees to receive. Review from February 1 through April 30. All forms must be saved for five years. Many employers, based on their size and industry, must electronically submit information from the record-keeping forms to OSHA each year. All employers are required to report fatalities within eight hours and inpatient hospitalizations, amputations, and loss of an eye within 24 hours."

Illnesses include both acute and chronic illnesses, such as, but not limited to, a skin disease, respiratory disorder, or poisoning. Subjective symptoms, such as aches and pains, can also be considered an injury or illness. If there is no injury or illness, the case does not need to be recorded. For example, exposures that do not result in signs or symptoms, are not considered an injury or illness and should, therefore, not be recorded. The existence of an injury or illness by itself does not make the case recordable. If an injury or illness is present, next determine if it is work-related."

The work environment is defined as the establishment and other locations where one or more employees are working or present as a condition of employment. This includes physical locations and the equipment and materials used by the employee during their work. Company-owned parking lots and sidewalks are considered part of the facility for record-keeping purposes. According to OSHA, a pre-existing condition is any injury or illness resulting solely from a non-work-related event or exposure that occurred outside the work environment. A pre-existing injury or illness has been significantly aggravated when an event or exposure in the work environment results in one of the following, which otherwise would not have occurred. Death, loss of consciousness, medical treatment, or one or more days away from work, restricted work, or a job transfer."

There are a couple of travel situations that are exceptions.

Also, injuries or illnesses that occur while commuting between the temporary residence and a fixed work site are not work-related.

For OSHA purposes, an injury or illness is a new case if The employee has not previously recorded an injury or illness of the same type that affects the same body part. Or The signs and symptoms had disappeared from a previous injury or illness, and an event or exposure in the work environment caused them to reappear. So, if an exposure triggers a recurrence, it is a new case. However, if signs and symptoms recur without exposure, it is not a new case. Some examples of chronic conditions that can recur without exposure may include silicosis, cancer, asbestosis, and tuberculosis. Employers are not required to seek medical advice from a licensed health care professional to determine if a case is a new case. However, if advice is sought, you must follow their recommendation. If you receive multiple recommendations, you must decide which recommendation is most authoritative and determine the case status based on that recommendation."

            "transcript": "OSHA's Occupational Noise Standard requires employers to conduct periodic audiometric testing of employees whose noise exposures are equal to or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 dBA. If an employee's hearing test, or audiogram, reveals that the employee experienced a change in hearing threshold of 10 decibels, or dB, averaged at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz relative to the baseline audiogram, they have experienced a standard threshold shift. If there is a standard threshold shift in hearing in one or both ears, and the employee's total hearing level, is 25 decibels, or dB, or more above audiometric zero, averaged at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz, in the same ear or ears as the standard threshold shift, the case must be recorded. Once a standard threshold shift has occurred, the employee's baseline audiogram should be revised to reflect the results of the current audiogram. Revisions are done on a per-ear basis. For example, if an employee suffers a standard threshold shift in only one ear, the baseline audiogram may only be revised for the affected ear, not both ears. An employee's hearing may be retested within 30 calendar days of the date the first test was administered. If the retest does not confirm the standard threshold shift, the case does not need to be recorded. If the retest confirms the standard threshold shift, and the standard threshold shift is work-related, the hearing loss must be recorded within seven calendar days of the retest. An employer may adjust for aging using the tables in the OSHA Hearing Conservation Standard to determine whether a standard threshold shift has occurred. However, an employer may not adjust for when determining if the hearing level is 25 dB or more above audiometric zero."

Establishments with 250 or more employees at any time during the previous calendar year are required to submit information from Form 300A once a year. 2. Establishments with 20 to 249 employees that are classified in an industry listed in Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 1904 are required to submit information from Form 300A once a year. Each individual employed at any time during the year counts as one employee, including full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary workers. OSHA provides a website called the Injury Tracking Application, or ITA, where employers can determine if an establishment is required to report electronically and, if so, submit their data. The submission deadline is March 2."

When these occur, employees will need to determine or help determine whether or not a case should be recorded on the OSHA 300 Log for their facility. Injury records are kept to help analyze injury causes, identify potential trends, and prevent future occurrences. Failure to properly record an injury or illness may also result in an OSHA violation and citation. Thus, it is extremely important to know and understand the OSHA rules and requirements for recording an injury or illness. This course will review the criteria for recording injuries and illnesses for OSHA purposes.",
