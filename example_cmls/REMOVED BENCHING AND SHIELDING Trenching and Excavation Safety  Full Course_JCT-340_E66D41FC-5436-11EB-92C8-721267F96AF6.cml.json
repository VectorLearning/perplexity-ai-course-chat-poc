            "transcript": "Excavating is one of the most dangerous operations in construction work. There are an average of 70 deaths each year in the U.S. due to excavation accidents and thousands more injuries. Most of these accidents could be prevented by following simple safety procedures. An excavation is any man-made cavity created in the ground by removing earth. A trench is a kind of excavation. It is a narrow channel that is deeper than it is wide. The term trench is typically applied to channels that are less than 15 feet, or 4.6 meters, wide at their base. Even if you are not in charge of overseeing an excavation, you must be familiar with the general hazards of this work. Knowing how to spot potential problems will help keep you and your coworkers safe. Note, completion of this lesson alone does not declare the learner as a competent person. The title of competent person is provided by the employer after having evaluated the worker's applied knowledge, skill, and authority. By the end of this course, you will be able to Identify common dangers associated with trenching and excavation work. Define competent person and discuss their role and their importance. Discuss the different types of soil and the importance of soil type in evaluating excavation and trenching hazards. And, identify and discuss the protective systems of sloping and shoring.

They can recognize any existing or potential excavation and related dangers, such as confined spaces or hazardous atmospheres. They must also have the authority to take appropriate actions to fix any problems that are found. The competent person also inspects the soil and decides what protective equipment will be used. The competent person must be readily available if problems arise or if there are questions about the excavation. Employers are responsible for determining who will serve as a competent person for excavation activities. These persons often have significant field experience and authority over field operations. The designation of competent person commonly falls on those who are titled supervisor, crew leader, or foreman. For small employers, the role of the competent person is often held by heavy equipment operators, namely those operating excavation equipment like an excavator or backhoe. It should be noted that when a site visit is made by an OSHA official, the designated competent person will be asked questions and requested to produce documents, such as inspection logs."

While the OSHA excavation standard requires safeguards for a trench at least 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, in depth, a trench less than 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, deep, can still cave in and cause serious injuries. One study reported that 35% of trenching injuries happened in excavations less than 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, deep. Safety starts with planning, and excavation work is no different than any other type of construction-related activity. In addition to OSHA's workplace safety regulations, the following requirements also contribute to preventing worker injury. Utility Locate Laws are specific to each state, and in most cases, the responsibility to request a utility locate falls on the excavator, the entity breaking ground, electrical, natural gas, water, and petroleum pipelines present a significant risk. Therefore, no excavation work shall proceed until a locate request has been made by dialing 811 and all utilities are confirmed cleared. Traffic Control This is required where excavation work is completed within or adjacent to a roadway. The control of the motoring public is critical to maintaining a safe work zone. Advanced warning signs and barriers help protect workers. All necessary permits and approvals must be obtained when working on public roadways."

It is recommended that the competent person use a checklist to complete their daily inspection. The checklist ensures that all necessary items will be evaluated and that the inspection is completed if asked by an OSHA official. The competent person must also inspect the excavation whenever any relevant site conditions have changed. Changes that would require a re-inspection include, but are not limited to, weather changes such as rainstorms, thaws, earthquakes, and snowstorms. When fissures, cracks, sloughing, water seepage, or other changes are noticed. If there is a change in the spoil pile location or size. When there is a change in the scope of the work requiring alternate excavation plans. If the competent person determines there is an excavation hazard, workers in the excavation must leave immediately. No one may re-enter until the hazard has been eliminated. The following section describes some of the more notable hazard items on a checklist that a competent person must evaluate."

Soil is very heavy, probably heavier than you'd expect. A cubic yard of dirt typically weighs around 2,700 pounds, or 1,224.6 kilograms. Being hit by a wall of earth is similar to being hit by a car. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can spot a potential cave-in before it happens. Soil can cave-in suddenly and without warning. A person buried in dirt will suffocate quickly. Even if the victim avoids suffocation, the weight of the soil can break bones and cause crushing injuries. The following sections will discuss the factors that contribute to cave-ins. In addition to cave-ins, other hazards may be present and must be accounted for by the contractor. Other excavation hazards discussed later in this course include Hazardous atmospheres Contacting buried utilities Being struck by, crushed by, falling objects And Falling into the excavation"

It's a fact that cohesive, or sticky, soil poses less of a danger of caving in than non-cohesive and granular soil. Determining the type of soil is the responsibility of the competent person and is accomplished by completing both a visual and physical examination of the soil. The physical tests performed on the soil to evaluate the cohesiveness can be accomplished by several methods, including the ribbon test, a pocket pentrometer device, or a sheer vein device. There are four primary soil types, as defined by their constituents and compressive strength. Solid rock, type A, type B, type C. Solid rock presents... The most stable soil conditions, followed by soil types A, B, and C. Note that frozen soil conditions cannot be treated like solid rock. All areas that have been previously excavated, or disturbed, must be treated as type C soil."

Protective methods include scaling of the excavation face and installation of protective barricades. Spoil is the earth that is dug out of an excavation and either cast next to the excavation or hauled away. Like nearby heavy equipment, spoil piles placed immediately next to the excavation place extra downward and inward force on the ground and can contribute to a cave-in. It also poses another risk because it could fall into an excavation on top of workers. To reduce risks associated with spoil piles, they must be either kept at least 2 feet or 0.6 meters away from the edge of a trench or, held back by some type of retaining wall or barrier."

Hazardous atmospheres include poisonous atmospheres, oxygen-deficient atmospheres, less than 19.5% oxygen, combustible atmospheres, and any atmosphere that may cause death, illness, or injury to persons exposed to it. One factor leading to hazardous atmospheres in excavations is the fact that some dangerous gases are heavier than air and will accumulate in low areas. This is where combustion engines are used nearby and carbon monoxide, or CO, gas accumulates in the trench. Compressors, generators, gas-powered equipment used in the trench, or idling equipment on top of the trench, present as a risk of death. This can be a CO hazard to the workers in the trench. Hitting buried utilities in the trench, like a sanitary sewer or natural gas line, presents immediate atmospheric and life safety hazards. If there is any chance that the atmosphere in an excavation could be or become hazardous, the competent person must take appropriate action. This might include air testing, installing air monitoring devices, and installing ventilation systems. The equipment and equipment must be made ready to be used before entering the trench, or continuously working in the trench. Additionally, proper personal protective equipment must be used. In any location where there may be a hazardous atmosphere, emergency rescue equipment, like respirators and other PPE for rescue personnel, must be made readily available."

Shoring a trench involves using supporting structures that brace the sides of the trench wall and physically prevent a cave-in. Shoring materials include wood and metal and may require the system to be designed by a registered professional engineer. Shoring prevents a cave-in by pressing up against and supporting the sidewalls of the excavation. The selection of the protective system by a competent person depends upon the visual and physical examination of the soil as well as an understanding of how the work will be performed.

The maximum allowable slope of Type C soil is 34 degrees. Type B soil has a maximum allowable slope of 45 degrees. Type A soil, being the most stable, has a maximum allowable slope of 53 degrees. Solid rock doesn't require sloping, or any protective system, because it is not at risk of collapsing. Many excavations will be on Earth with two or more layers of different soil types. The two soil layers can be sloped separately. For example, an excavation may have a Type B soil layer on top of a Type A soil layer. If other factors are present, like water or vibration, the competent person must decide if the slope needs to be lower than the maximum allowable slope. When in doubt about the soil type, the soil must be sloped for Type C soil. This will ensure that the sloping is adequate for all soil types. These sloping requirements only apply to excavations less than 20 feet, or 6 meters, deep. Excavations deeper than 20 feet, or 6 meters, and by a registered professional engineer."

Of all the hazards, cave-ins are the deadliest. The soil type is the primary factor in cave-ins, but other factors include water, heavy equipment, spoil piles, and vibrations. The three types of systems that protect against cave-ins are sloping, shoring. Even if someone else is the competent person in charge of an excavation, you should know the dangers of this type of work. Always be aware of your surroundings, and never take your safety for granted when working in trenches and excavations."
