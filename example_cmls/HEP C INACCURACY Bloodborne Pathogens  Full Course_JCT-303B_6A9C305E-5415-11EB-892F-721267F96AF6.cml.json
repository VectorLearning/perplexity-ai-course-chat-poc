I cut my hand. Uh, the first aid kit. Is everything okay? Oh, whoa, we need to get to urgent care. Yeah, can you drive him? Yeah. Gloves. Right, the pathogens training. It's all right, we'll clean it up later. Okay. Just put something on it. Okay. Here, put pressure on it with this. Okay. All right, let's go. Okay. Oh. I think it's only five minutes. All right, you're gonna be okay. That happened yesterday. Poor Miguel. I know, that was scary. I didn't know what to do. You did great. You even remembered to put gloves on. Good thing we took that first aid training course last week. For real, great timing. What's up, guys? Mind if I help with my one good hand here? Yeah, just be careful. Least I can do for complicating the task. I, um, just wanted to thank you both. Seriously. The bandaging, taking me to the hospital, everything. Thank you. Hey, it's no problem. All right, let's go."

            "transcript": "When you see someone get hurt or injured, is your first instinct to help? For your own safety, it's best to take a moment to assess some things first. Most importantly, could you be exposed to blood or other body fluids? When someone has a cut or puncture wound, or other traumatic injury, it is important to stop the bleeding, but you must consider blood-borne pathogens. What are those? Blood-borne pathogens are infectious microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria. That, if present in blood, can cause disease in humans. These pathogens can be transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person by contact with infected blood, other body fluids, or unfixed tissue and organs, other than intact skin. A number of relatively simple actions can be taken to drastically reduce the chance of exposure to blood-borne pathogens. This is especially important for healthcare workers, and others who are at an increased risk of exposure. Depending on the facility, equipment, and type of work being done, workplace controls, practices, and methods can be added or modified to minimize the chance of exposure. Appropriate personal protective equipment also helps to prevent the transfer of blood-borne pathogens from an infected person to a healthy person. By the end of this course, you will be able to Define the term blood-borne pathogen List and describe common types of blood-borne pathogens Explain how blood-borne pathogens are transmitted to humans, and how they can be used in the treatment of blood-borne pathogens and the risks they present. Describe techniques for transmission prevention, and Describe what you should do if you think you may have been exposed to a blood-borne pathogen."

For others, it becomes chronic, meaning it lasts longer than six months. Short-term symptoms range from none at all to vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine, and abdominal pain. Most victims recover fully after contracting HPV, even if their symptoms are severe. However, approximately 5% of adults who are infected develop chronic lifelong hepatitis. Most chronic sufferers have few ongoing symptoms. However, they are at an increased risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer, both of which are life-threatening conditions. There is a vaccine to prevent HPV, but there is no cure. For chronic HPV sufferers, antiviral medications can sometimes slow the progression of the disease. If there is a reasonable chance that a worker may come into contact with blood-borne pathogens while performing normal job tasks, their employer must cover the cost of a Hepatitis B vaccination if requested by a worker."

Most chronic sufferers have few symptoms initially, or for many subsequent years, but they are at a high risk of developing cirrhosis, liver disease, or liver cancer. There is no vaccine to prevent HCV. Antiviral medicines have been developed that are over 95% effective in eliminating the virus, but they are very expensive. In some cases, a liver transplant may be necessary. While the transplant itself won’t cure Hepatitis C, subsequent treatments will help to prevent it."

With a weakened immune system, these infections can be life-threatening. When a person's immune system is severely damaged, they are said to have AIDS. HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years if left untreated. There is no vaccine for HIV and no cure. However, there are medicines that can control HIV and prevent complications.

Infection can be transmitted by such activities as deliberate sharing of a needle, as is common in illicit drug use. A needle contaminated by an infected person's blood provides a direct route of transmission if it is reused by an uninfected person. A needle stick is the unintentional action of being poked with a needle. It has the same unfortunate effect as deliberate needle sharing if the needle has been contaminated. Cuts from other contaminated sharps, including but not limited to broken glass, scalpels, exposed dental wires, and broken capillary tubes. Sexual contact with an infected partner.

The risk of infection from a blood transfusion is low in places where the blood supply is screened and monitored. It may be higher in countries and locations where this is not done.

A used medical needle is dangerous due to the high probability that it will retain a small amount of blood after it is used, and due to its extreme sharpness, the high probability that it can accidentally penetrate someone else's skin and expose them to the retained blood. Accidental needle stick injuries are especially common in healthcare industries, but they are also a real and growing risk in manufacturing and other industries. As more people with diabetes, allergies, and other conditions use syringes to self-administer medicine. To prevent sharps and needle stick injuries, have a plan for handling and disposal before you use a needle or other sharp instrument or clean up broken glass. Use needle alternatives when possible. Activate the device's safety features, if applicable, and immediately dispose of contaminated sharps in a designated sharps container."

Side effects are usually mild and include soreness or redness in the area where the shot was given and fever. However, serious reactions are very rare. Employers must make hepatitis B vaccinations available to all employees who might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens, free of charge at a reasonable time and place within 10 working days of initial assignment. An exception is allowed if the employee is already vaccinated, antibody testing shows they are immune, or the vaccine is contraindicated for medical reasons. The vaccination must be performed by a licensed healthcare professional. If the employee is already vaccinated, the vaccination must be performed by a licensed healthcare professional. If the employee declines the vaccine, they must sign a declination form. However, the vaccine must be provided at a later date if the employee changes their mind."

They involve a physical change to the workplace itself, rather than relying on the employees to follow a procedure or wear protective clothing. When correctly designed and implemented, engineering controls are the best solutions for preventing exposure because they are generally more effective and more reliable than other types of controls. The engineering controls used at a workplace depend, to a great degree, on the nature of the work being done. One example of an engineering control to reduce the spread of blood-borne pathogens in a healthcare facility would be the use of self-chiefing needles for the injection of medications. This adaptation completely eliminates the possibility of subsequent needle sticks. Another example is the addition of designated sharps disposal containers to a work area. Engineering controls should be installed in a workplace to prevent exposure to hazardous conditions. Engineering controls should be expected and maintained or replaced on a regular basis."

Immediately or as soon as possible after exiting a potentially contaminated area. Gloves and other protective clothing should be removed, and hands should be thoroughly washed. Employers with employees with the potential for exposure should provide suitable hand-washing facilities. Apply a non-abrasive antibacterial soap. Rub your hands together under running water for at least 20 seconds. Rinse your hands. And dry them with a disposable towel. If running water is unavailable, an antiseptic hand cleanser and towels or antiseptic towelettes can be used, and then use them to clean your hands. and then use them to clean your hands.
