Practice good housekeeping techniques that eliminate conditions that could create a fire. Inspect equipment to ensure it is in proper working order. Ensure that all electrical systems are checked by a licensed electrician. Test fire suppression systems and fire alarms to ensure they are functioning properly. Perform all hot work away from combustible materials and adhere to hot work permits and policies. And store all flammable and combustible liquids in appropriate containers, cabinets, and locations."

Heat, fuel, oxygen, and an unrestrained chemical reaction are all required to sustain a fire. If any of these four elements are removed, the fire cannot continue. When you encounter a small fire or one that is just starting, you may be able to extinguish it with a fire extinguisher or other available tools or materials. If the fire is small enough, you may be able to smother it with a blanket, removing the fire's access to oxygen. You could use a similar technique by using a shovel to smother the fire with dirt."
